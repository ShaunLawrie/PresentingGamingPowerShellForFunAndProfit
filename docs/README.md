# How to Get This Working

I knocked this together for the presentation so it's very rough and ready.  
Some pre-requisites are needed to get this working. If you run into any issues see getting help below.

## âœ… Pre-requisites

 - A decent terminal emulator (cmd.exe doesn't count) - I use [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal)
 - A version of PowerShell > 7 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.4
 - The `pwsh` command should be available in your terminal, if it's not then you may need to quit and open it again to refresh the path

## ðŸ‘Ÿ Getting started

I wrote this during the demo, the game I created is in [`example/`](example/).  
To run the game you can use the following command:

```pwsh
git clone git@github.com:ShaunLawrie/PwshSpectreConsole
cd PwshSpectreConsole
cd example
pwsh .\game.ps1
```
